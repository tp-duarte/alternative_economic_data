The data sources for expenditure and disposable income of the California 
state are generated in an yearly basis, but they were aggregated in the database
in a quarterly frequency.

This won't catch seasonalities and it's a warning sign to the ML process step.
Since the data was generated after the GDP we also have to estimate it partially when making 
predictions intead of using it directly from the database. This way we don't incurr in data leakage.
